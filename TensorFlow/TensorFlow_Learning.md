What is a tensor?

scalar
vector
tensor

GPU: Graphics Processing Unit, very fast at crunching numbers.

TPU: Tensor Processing Unit. AI accelerotr application specific integrated circuit ASIC

Why TF?

- Easy model building
- Robust ML production anywhere
- Powerful experimental for research

What is TensorFlow?

- End to end platform for machine learning
- Write fast deep learning code in Python and other accessible languages (Able to run on a GPU/TPU)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning modes (TF Hub)
- Whole Stack: Preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application
- Oringinally designed and used in-house by Google (Now open source)

What is Deep learning actually used for?

- Recommendation
- Translation
- Speech recognition - Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)
- Computer vision (Classification / Regression)
- Natural Language Processing: NLP: SPAM / NOT SPAM

---

Types of Learning

- Supervised learning. Data with labels
- Semi-supervised Learning. Data with some labels
- Unsupervised Learning. Only have data, no labels
- Transfer Learning. Takinw what one NN learned on what data and use it on another NN

---

Anatomy of a neural network

- input layer
- hidden layer(s) (Learns patterns in data)
- output layer

---

What are neural networks?

- Input
- numerical encoding (tensor)
- Numerical model will Learn representation
- Representation output
- utput

---

Many algorithms cna be used for both

Structured Data Processing: (Shallow algorithms)

- Random forest
- Naive bayes
- Nearest neighbour
- Support vector machine
- ...

Unstructured Data (Common algorithms)

- **_Neural networks_**
- **_Fully connected neural networks_**
- **_Convolutional neural networks_**
- **_Recurremnt neural networks_**
- Transformer
- ...

DL NOT good for:

- When you need explainibility
- When the traditional approach is better
- When errors are unpredictable
- When you don't have much data.
  - we'll see how to get good results with limited data.

Machine Learning: Structured data

Deep Learning: Unstructured data

DL good for:

- Problems with long list of rules
- Continually changing environments
- Discovering insights within large collection of data

If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning- do that.

Deep learning

Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org › wiki › Deep_learning
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms that : 199–200 uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input.

Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finiding patterns in those numbers
