### Variable notation

- camelCase
- snake_case
- PascalCase

### Variables can only contain:

- numbers
- letters
- dollar sign $
- underscore
- "name" is reserved keyword
- PI is a constant - all capital.
- Variable names can't start with number. Syntax error

### Data Types

Value

- object
- primitive
  - Number
  - String
  - Boolean
  - Undefined
  - Null
  - Symbol (ES2015)
  - BigInt (ES2020)

Data types are determined AUTOMATICALLY in JS
The value that stores the data type not the variable

Dynamic Typing

Undefined means: Empty value:

let year;
year = 2001;

console.log (typeof year);

### NULL

**Bug in JS: Type of null is Object.**
null is a datatype similar to undefined
Value and types are BOTH NULL.

This is not corrected for legacy reasons

### Commnets:

Single line Comment //

Block Comment: Command slash -

/\* \*/

This is my 2nd commit as I'm experimenting with GitHub
28/09/2023

### 2 Github testing: Motherfucking VIM, Idiotic Apple keyboard layout!

Motherfucking VIM, and Apple keyboard layout

Problem:
I synced up GitHub and VSC on my PC laptop, I wanted to clone the repo to my macbook.
I opened VSC on my macbook, but GitHub didn't accept the authorization.
I had to set up the SSH key for my Mac. I found a YouTube tutorial.
It used VIM to make the config file...but I have Hungarian keyboard where the star symbol is missing and
couldn't find it on keyboard maps. I was messing around so VIM got into an insert mode I couldn't add text anymore.
Then after 10 minutes I realized there are other terminal editors, I googled and remembered NANO.
But nano doesn't have the :wq to write and quit. it had CTRL X.

### 3 VSC updated with Extensions

- Auto Open Markdown
- Colorize
- Eslint
- GitLens
- Import Cost
- Peacock
- Project Manager
- vscode icons
- indent rainbow
