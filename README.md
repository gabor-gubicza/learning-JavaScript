Switching from HW to SW is going to be a major effort. I need to be collected, organized, focused, rested and dedicated.

I reformatted my Readme- Logbook so the most upto date is on top.

### 2 Github testing: Motherfucking VIM, Idiotic Apple keyboard layout!
Motherfucking VIM, and Apple keyboard layout

Problem: 
I synced up GitHub and VSC on my PC laptop, I wanted to clone the repo to my macbook.
I opened VSC on my macbook, but GitHub didn't accept the authorization. 
I had to set up the SSH key for my Mac. I found a YouTube tutorial.
It used VIM to make the config file...but I have Hungarian keyboard where the star symbol is missing and
couldn't find it on keyboard maps. I was messing around so VIM got into an insert mode I couldn't add text anymore.
Then after 10 minutes I realized there are other terminal editors, I googled and remembered NANO.
But nano doesn't have the :wq to write and quit. it had CTRL X.
